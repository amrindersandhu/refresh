        <h4>1.2 Workspaces</h4>
        <p>We have a brand new workspace selector which lets you quickly switch between workspaces which were used recently. You can now search through different types of workspaces without having to switch tabs. Just type the name of the workspace you want to go to.</p>
        <p>And oh! We now have <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace">public workspaces</a> These are just like any other workspace but visible to everyone on the internet and easily accessible via Postman API network. Create a new public workspace and share your APIs with millions of Postman users around the world.</p>
        <h4>1.3 Reports</h4>
        <p>Available on the Enterprise and Business tiers, <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/view-and-analyze-api-reports/">reports</a>  help you understand how your organization is building and consuming APIs. Get insights about requests, collection runs and test failures. Administrators can also use reports to analyze how Postman is being used across the organization.</p>
        <h4>1.4 Explore</h4>
        <p>One stop solution to explore all APIs published in the Postman API network. Browse through different teams and their public workspaces to discover new APIs. Read on to know more about this.</p>
        <h4>1.5 Universal Search</h4>
        <p>Universal search makes it incredibly easy to search and discover any private or public API element. It looks through all API elements in your account, the private API network, and the Public API Network to help you get started in a few clicks.</p>
        <p><img src="https://skills-assets.pstmn.io/release-notes-assets/universal-search.gif"/></p>
        <h3>2. A unified interface for web and native</h3>
        <h4>2.1 Panes</h4>
        <p>The main working area is now divided into <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/getting-started/navigating-postman/">Panes</a>, which help you customize the Postman interface to match your preferred work environment. You can expand and adjust relevant panes so that the right information is accessible readily.</p>
        <p><img src="https://skills-assets.pstmn.io/release-notes-assets/panes.gif"/></p>
        <h4>2.2 Updated sidebar</h4>
        <p>Postman v8 lets you access collections, environments, mock servers, monitors and request history right from the sidebar. You can easily author, search and modify any of these elements without leaving the app. The whole sidebar acts like a pane which can be resized and also collapsed based on your liking.</p>
        <h4>2.3 Context bars</h4>
        <p>Context bars provide information relevant to the element you’re viewing in a workspace. Here, you can access documentation for an element, see pull requests, add comments or just copy the ID for CI/CD integration.</p>
        <p><img src="https://skills-assets.pstmn.io/release-notes-assets/context-bars.gif"/></p>
        <h3>3. All the world’s APIs are just a click away</h3>
        <p>Postman v8 not only simplifies your API development experience but also makes exploring APIs a piece of cake. Browse through hundreds of third party APIs in the “Explore” section. Here, you can look at collections published by different teams and navigate through them just like you do in your own workspace.</p>
        <p>Interested in an API? Want to send a request? It is just a few clicks away. Just  <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/version-control-for-collections/#forking-a-collection">fork</a>  the collection into your workspace and you’re good to go.</p>
        <p>But wait! Even you can be a part of the  <a href="https://www.postman.com/explore">Postman API network</a>. Simply create a  <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/collaborating-in-postman/using-workspaces/creating-workspaces/#creating-a-public-workspace">public workspace</a>  and share your collections in it - they are automatically available to millions of Postman users.</p>
        <p>Like to contribute to someone else’s API? That’s easy too! Fork the collection into your workspace, make the changes and raise a pull request.</p>

        <ul>
          <li></li>This release has an important security update: we’re adding PKCE support for the Authorization Code Grant in OAuth 2.0 to help prevent authorization code interception attacks. (Fun fact: apparently, PKCE is pronounced “pixy.” The more you know!)<a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/3825">#3825</a>
        </ul>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>

        <h2>Postman v7.22.1</h2>
        <p>Hello. We hope you’re safe and well. There’s a lot going on right now, so we really appreciate you taking the time to read about what we’ve released to make working with APIs easier.</p>
        <h3>What’s new</h3>
        <ul>
          <li></li>We’re really excited to announce that Postman now supports writing RAML 1.0-type APIs.  This new version brings a lot of new improvements including support for declaring Data Types, Libraries and Annotations, while also enhancing the way security schemas are written.
          <li></li>See who's in your workspace with new avatars next to the workspace menu. For workspaces with more than 3 users, click on the number next to the avatars for a full list of workspace members and to see who’s currently active. <a href="https://learning.postman.com/docs/postman/workspaces/intro-to-workspaces/#seeing-who-is-in-your-workspace&amp;utm_source=postman&amp;utm_medium=release%20notes">Learn more</a>
          <li></li>Take a tour of the API Builder to learn how Postman can help you design, develop and manage your API throughout its lifecycle.
        </ul>
        <h3>Improvements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li></li>Working with GraphQL in Postman just got a lot easier now that there’s support for writing GraphQL schemas in JSON.
          <li>On top of that, you can now directly import a GraphQL schema as an API.</li>
          <li></li>If you want to suggest changes to a collection but you’re only a Viewer, you can now fork the collection, make your changes and create a pull request to have them reviewed.
          <li></li>We moved the “Use Token” button to the top of the OAuth 2.0 “Manage Access Tokens” screen, so you won’t have to scroll in order to find it. We also found and fixed a related issue where the “Get New Access Token” screen would overflow, hiding buttons and form fields<a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/8067">#8067</a>.
          <li></li>The tooltips for the response’s status, time and size were a bit temperamental. Now they won’t disappear the instant you move your cursor.
          <li></li>Performance improvements for:<em>Typing a URL when there are a lot of autocomplete suggestions <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/5990">#5990</a></em> Opening a new tab when multiple tabs are already open<em>Downloading and saving large responses <a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/7871">#7871</a></em> The environment quicklook menu

          <li></li>Fixed an issue where using the keyboard shortcut to toggle the two-pane view wouldn’t update the settings<a href="https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-app-support/issues/7212">#7212</a>.
