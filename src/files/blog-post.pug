                <p>I am excited to announce a huge milestone for Postman today: We’ve closed a Series D investment round of $225 million that values the company at $5.6 billion. The round was led by <a href="https://www.insightpartners.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Insight Partners</a> and joined by three new investors—<a href="https://www.coatue.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Coatue</a>, <a href="https://www.battery.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Battery Ventures</a>, and <a href="https://www.bondcap.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">BOND</a>. We also had enthusiastic participation from existing Postman investors <a href="https://www.crv.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">CRV</a> and <a href="https://nexusvp.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Nexus Venture Partners</a>. In addition, DoorDash Product Leader Gokul Rajaram and Freshworks Founder Girish Mathrubootham joined as individual investors.</p>

                    | APIs have quickly become the fundamental building blocks of software used by developers in every industry, in every country across the globe—and Postman has firmly established itself as the preferred platform for developers,” said Insight Partners Managing Director Jeff Horing. “Postman has the opportunity to become a key pillar of how enterprises build, deliver products, and seamlessly enable partnerships across the ecosystem. Their continued, rapid expansion and strong management team point to a future for Postman with virtually unlimited possibilities.”

                <p>A little over a year ago, Postman closed a Series C investment round, and in that <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postmans-series-c-funding-and-the-future-of-apis/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">announcement blog post</a> I described the “Postman flywheel” that helps guide us in our decisions on how to make the Postman platform increasingly powerful and effective for our customers.</p>

                    figcaption The Postman flywheel


                <p>Today, the Postman flywheel is running faster than it ever has, with strong momentum in a number of key areas:</p>

                <ul class="list-unordered"><li aria-level="1"><b>Developers:</b> There are now 17 million developers on the <a href="https://www.postman.com/api-platform/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Postman API Platform</a>, and the Postman app has been downloaded more than 60 million times so far.</li><li aria-level="1"><b>Collaboration for teams:</b> After recently announcing <a href="https://blog.postman.com/announcing-unlimited-collaboration-for-small-teams/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">unlimited collaboration</a> for small teams in Postman, we’re seeing record amounts of collaboration activity on the platform today.</li><li aria-level="1"><b>Enterprise customers:</b> We continue to add phenomenal customers like Salesforce, Stripe, Kroger, Cisco, PayPal, and more. You can read more on our <a href="https://www.postman.com/case-studies/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">case studies</a> page.</li><li aria-level="1"><b>The Public API Network:</b> The Postman Public API Network recently became the <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postman-public-api-network-is-now-the-worlds-largest-public-api-hub/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">world’s largest public API hub</a>, and it has quickly grown to more than 20,000 <a href="https://blog.postman.com/public-workspaces-why-we-created-them-what-you-can-do/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">public workspaces</a> (from top organizations like <a href="https://www.postman.com/mbdevelopers/workspace/mercedes-benz/overview" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Mercedes-Benz</a>, <a href="https://blog.postman.com/how-to-explore-notion-api-postman-public-workspace/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Notion</a>, <a href="https://www.postman.com/microsoftgraph/workspace/microsoft-graph/overview" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">Microsoft Graph</a>, and more) that enable developers, teams, and companies around the world to work together on APIs at a scale that was never before possible.</li></ul>

                <h2 id="the-api-first-world">The API-first world</h2>
                
                <p>Along with this momentum at Postman and <a href="https://blog.postman.com/api-growth-rate/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">in the API industry overall</a>, we’ve also observed a bigger shift that’s directly related to it all: The world is increasingly becoming API-first.</p>

                <p>Now, there’s quite a bit of discussion across the industry these days about what exactly “API-first” means, so we decided to choose an unconventional medium to explain it. Folks here at Postman are big fans of reading, and of science fiction, and of graphic novels, so we decided to create a graphic novel to describe the API-first world.</p>

                <p>Shruthi Venkatesh, a visual designer here at Postman, brought this idea to life with her illustrations in a brand-new graphic novel that I am very excited about sharing with you, <a href="https://api-first-world.com/" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">“The API-First World.”</a> Please give it a read.</p>

                <p>Now that you’ve seen this vision of the API-first world through our new graphic novel, you might ask: What is Postman doing to bring about that vision? To get there, Postman has been relentlessly focused on—and will continue to focus on in the future via the Series D investment—the two foundational elements of Postman’s success to date: the product and the community. Here’s a recap of some of the recent activity in each of these areas:</p>

                <p>The API-first world requires an API platform that enables more people to do more with APIs, and Postman continues to release new capabilities at a fast pace to achieve that objective. Just a few examples: <a href="https://blog.postman.com/announcing-postman-for-the-web-now-in-open-beta/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Postman on the web</a>, <a href="https://blog.postman.com/public-workspaces-why-we-created-them-what-you-can-do/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">public workspaces</a>, the <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postman-api-network-intro/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Private API Network</a>, the <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postman-public-api-network-is-now-the-worlds-largest-public-api-hub/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Public API Network</a>, <a href="https://blog.postman.com/security-warnings-during-api-validation/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">API security validations</a>, <a href="https://blog.postman.com/real-time-validation-of-openapi-definitions-in-postman-api-builder/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">OpenAPI validations</a>, support for protocols like <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postman-supports-websocket-apis/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">WebSockets</a> and <a href="https://blog.postman.com/making-http-soap-requests-with-postman/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">SOAP</a>, user groups, and <a href="https://blog.postman.com/introducing-user-management-in-postman-with-scim/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">SCIM integration</a>, along with hundreds of other improvements.</p>

                <p>We also completed the <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postmans-new-soc-2-type-2-report-how-and-why-we-did-it/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">SOC 2 Type 2</a> security-validation milestone this year, while also creating new partnerships with <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postman-datadog-technology-partner-more-integration-features/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Datadog</a>, <a href="https://blog.postman.com/monitor-apis-with-postman-and-new-relic/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">New Relic</a>, <a href="https://blog.postman.com/postman-opsgenie-integration/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">Opsgenie</a>, and <a href="https://blog.postman.com/aws-api-gateway-integration-postman/" data-wpel-link="internal" target="_self">AWS API Gateway</a> to help our customers solve many modern challenges.</p>

                p Coatue was impressed by Postman’s ability to solve challenges faced by developers worldwide who need to build software faster than ever. We also liked Postman’s work towards providing management teams, regardless of size, proper visibility into their API landscape and to ensure that increasingly lean teams can effectively maintain APIs,” said Coatue General Partner David Schneider.
