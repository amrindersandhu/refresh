                h4 Vulnerability Management
                p
                    | Our security team performs Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) of our ongoing releases, interfacing with products and services. All vulnerabilities found during VAPTs are managed internally in our vulnerability management system. All vulnerabilities are assigned a score, using the CVSS scoring system, and an owner. We also have an internal SLA that stipulates deadlines for fixing vulnerabilities.
                h4 Employee Access
                p
                    | To manage employee access, we have implemented an audited security policy (IAM) that includes access control, a secure password policy, BYOD, and secure network access.

                p
                    | We maintain all internal testing and validation data in a production-stack equivalent internal stack populated with fictitious data. Postman does not distribute actual customer data for internal testing or validation purposes.
                p
                    | We have instituted a role-based access process to govern access to any customer data required for customer support (or otherwise). This process is audited and recorded and includes a human arbitration done by a core team. Consisting of the founders and VP of Engineering, This team validates the requirement hypothesis and ensures data is obfuscated and sanitized before communicating back to customer support or engineering. Customer data classified as sensitive is not accessible by any party except the customer.
                h4 Attack Prevention and Mitigation
                p
                    | We maintain intelligent, web application firewalls on our load balancers which, along with the elastic scaling capacity of our compute instances, mitigate attacks at the application layer.
                p
                    | We log activity across our platform, from individual API requests to infrastructure configuration changes. Logs are aggregated for monitoring, analysis, and anomaly detection and archived in vaulted storage. We implement measures to detect and prevent log tampering or interruptions. In order to determine security breaches, we monitor access patterns and network data flow patterns using automated systems that alert us in case of an anomaly. We also keep track of private contacts and public channels from our open-source and third-party technology stacks for any security-related reports. In case of a customer-reported breach, the CTO, CEO, and VP of Engineering are notified automatically and the report is responded to within a few hours as per set policies.

                    li Gather and preserve evidence for investigative efforts
                    li Conduct and document a postmortem and develop a permanent triage plan
